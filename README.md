This repository contains machine learning algorithms I implemented for classifying gestures using data collected from an ultra-wideband (UWB) radar. The work is based on the attached research study, leveraging the UWB-Gestures dataset, which includes various hand gesture samples obtained with impulse radar sensors. I utilized the PyTorch library for developing and training the classification models.
